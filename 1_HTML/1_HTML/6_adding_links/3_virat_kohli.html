            Virat Kohli (born 5 November 1988) is an Indian international cricketer and the former captain of the Indian national 
            cricket team who plays for Royal Challengers Bangalore in the IPL and Delhi in domestic cricket. Considered to be one 
            of the best cricketers in the world, he is widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen in the history of the sport.
            Nicknamed "The King", due to his dominant style of play and popularity, Kohli holds numerous records in his career 
            across all formats. In 2020, the International Cricket Council named him the male cricketer of the decade. Kohli has
            also contributed to India's successes, captaining the team from 2014 to 2022, and winning the 2011 World Cup and the
            2013 Champions trophy. He is among the only four Indian cricketers who have played over 500 matches for India.

            Born and raised in New Delhi, Kohli trained at the West Delhi Cricket Academy and started his youth career with the
            Delhi Under-15 team. He made his international debut in 2008 and quickly became a key player in the ODI team and 
            later made his Test debut in 2011. In 2013, Kohli reached the number one spot in the ICC rankings for ODI batsmen
            for the first time. During 2014 T20 World Cup, he set a record for the most runs scored in the tournament. In 2018,
            he achieved yet another milestone, becoming the world's top-ranked Test batsman, making him the only Indian 
            cricketer to hold the number one spot in all three formats of the game. His form continued in 2019, when he became
            the first player to score 20,000 international runs in a single decade. In 2021, Kohli made the decision to step 
            down as the captain of the Indian national team for T20Is, following the T20 World Cup and in early 2022 he stepped 
            down as the captain of the Test team as well.
